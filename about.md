def buildDeveloper()(Scala): FunctionalProgramming = {
 YearOfExperience > 10
}

I'm a Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience, motivator, leader, passionate about teamwork as a way to achieve results and subsist in time. I'm faithful to the principles of functional programming and defender of creation simple and maintainable code. I'm Interested in real-time applications, integral security, and business management that require new technologies and agile developments. I have extensive knowledge of different programming languages, architectural patterns and main frameworks of development. However, there is always room for improvement so I'm always looking to explore new ideas, learn from my peers, have new experiences and engage with new challenges.

"Programming is science, art, and engineering."

I'm a functional programming, author, speaker, entrepreneur, and long-time software architect and engineer. I love startups, technology, science, software engineering, fitness, and my family.

In addition to my consulting business, I'm currently [CTO at SlamData](http://slamdata.com), a company building [cool open source software](http://github.com/slamdata) for NoSQL analytics.

I've blogged on and off since 2000. Mostly off. This is my most recent attempt, fueled by my desire to write articles in Markdown and publish using Git.

At some point, I should probably put my resume on this page. Until then, you can find something that vaguely resembles a resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.owner.linkedin }}).

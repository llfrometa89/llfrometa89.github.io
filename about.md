I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in architecture design and development with strong problem-solving skills. I'm an advocate of functional programming and creating simple and maintainable code. I have strong self-organization and time-management skills. 
I'm interested in building powerful, reactive, concurrent, and distributed applications. I have extensive knowledge of different programming languages, architectural patterns and the principal development frameworks.
However, there is always room for improvement so I'm constantly looking to explore new ideas, learn from my peers, have new experiences and engage with new challenges.

This is my blog attempt, fueled by my desire to share my knowledge.

You can find something that vaguely resembles a resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.owner.linkedin }}).

_"Programming is science, art, and engineering."_

```scala
def buildDeveloper()(Scala): FunctionalProgramming = {
 YearOfExperience > 10
}
```

```scala
def buildDeveloper()(Scala): FunctionalProgramming = {
 YearOfExperience > 10
}
```

I'm a functional programming, motivator, leader, and long-time software architect and engineer. I'm faithful to the principles of functional programming and defender of creation simple and maintainable code, I love technology, science, software engineering and my family.

I have extensive knowledge of different programming languages, architectural patterns and main frameworks of development. However, there is always room for improvement so I'm always looking to explore new ideas, learn from my peers, have new experiences and engage with new challenges.

This is my blog attempt, fueled by my desire to share my knowledge.

You can find something that vaguely resembles a resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.owner.linkedin }}).

"Programming is science, art, and engineering."
